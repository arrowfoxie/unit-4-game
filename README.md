Crystal Collector Game

This is a simple game built with Javascript and jQuery.

As soon as the user navigates to the page, a random number will appear at the top next to "Your goal:". 
The page will display this random number, number of wins and losses, current score, and a set of four crystals.
To play, the player simply clicks on a crystal and a number will appear next to the score count. 
Each crystal should have a random value assigned to it each game. 
The purpose is for the player to reach the goal score by clicking the crystals until the current score equals the goal.
If the player reaches the goal, an alert will trigger informing the player that they have won, and a win will be recorded.
If the player goes over the goal, an alert triggers informing the player that they have lost, and a loss is recorded.
